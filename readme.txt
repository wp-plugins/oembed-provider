An oEmbed provider for Wordpress.

== Description ==

The oEmbed provider plugin makes Wordpress an oEmbed provider, compliant with the XML and JSON specification at http://www.oembed.com.

oEmbed is a powerful protocol that allows sites to automatically embed content from 3rd parties directly into their site in whatever way they choose. For example, if a user on http://identi.ca links to a Wordpress blog with this plugin enabled, the link, when clicked, will show an excerpt from the blog post, the authors name, and various links... automatically.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to `oembed-provider.php` in the `/wp-content/plugins/oembed-provider/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Step 3? There is no step 3!
